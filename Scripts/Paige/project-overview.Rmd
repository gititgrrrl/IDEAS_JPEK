# How do host and parasite traits predict parasite species richness across host threat levels? 

Overall, we predict parasite species richness will decrease when hosts are classified as more threatened. 

However, we predict this general pattern might not be the same across all host and parasite traits. 

*Host* traits we are interested in studying include: 

* host threat status (either binary or grouped IUCN levels)
* group size
* population decline

*Parasite* traits we're interested in include: 

* type (bacteria, virus, protozoa, etc.)
* transmission mode (close, non-close, vector)
* host breadth (mpd)
